<h1>How To Install JavaPOS-SPF-Test (Windows)</h1>
You need only the following files from the project root:
<ul>
    <li/>JavaPOS-SPF-Test.cmd
    <li/>jpos.properties
    <li/>jpos.xml
    <li/>jar\JavaPOS-SPF-Test.jar
</ul>
If the services you like to test use JavaPOS-SPF, the following additional file must be present in the jar folder:
<ul>
    <li/>jar\JavaPOS-SPF.jar
</ul>
If the device you like to test uses COM ports for communication (no matter if real COM ports, via Usb2Serial or Bluetooth),
you need one of
<ul>
    <li/>jar\SerialIOJNAWindows.jar,
    <li/>jar\SerialIOJSerialComm.jar or
    <li/>jar\SerialIOJSSC.jar (only if Java version &lt; 9).
</ul>
and the corresponding jar files from project JNA (version &ge; 5.5, needed by SerialIOJNAWindows.jar), JSerialComm (version
&ge; 2.6, needed by SerialIOJSerialComm.jar) or jSSC (version &ge; 2.7, needed by SerialIOJSSC.jar).<br>
Currently, recommended for serial communication are jar\SerialIOJSerialComm.jar in combination with jSerialComm-2.6.2.jar.<p/>
Since you like to test some device services, you need the corresponding jar files as well.<p/>
If you like to use one of the device simulators of JavaPOS-SPF, add the corresponding jar file as well.<p/>
In addition, you need the jar files from the following projects:
<ul>
    <li/>jpos (version 1.14),
    <li/>log4j (version 1.2),
    <li/>xalan-j (version &ge; 2.7).
</ul>
Here the steps for installation:
<ul>
    <li/>If not present: Install a Java runtime, recommended is a runtime version &ge; 9 and - if Java version &ge; 9 -
    JavaFX.
    <li/>Set the environment variable <b>JAVA_HOME</b> to the folder where you installed the Java runtime.
    <li/>Set the environment variable <b>JFX_HOME</b> to the folder where you installed JavaFX. If you use a JRE which
    includes JavaFX, <b>JFX_HOME</b> must not be set.
    <li/>Copy JavaPOS-SPF-Test.cmd and jpos.xml to any target folder.
    <li/>Create a sub-folder <i>res</i> in a sub-folder <i>jpos</i> in the target folder
    <li/>Copy jpos.properties into that <i>jpos\res</i> sub-folder.
    <li/>Create a sub-folder <i>jar</i> in the target folder.
    <li/>Copy all necessary jar files into that <i>jar</i> sub-folder.
    <li/>Add entries for the devices you like to test to jpos.xml in the target folder.
</ul>
That's all! Start JavaPOS-SPF-Test.cmd to start your tests.
<h1>How To Install JavaPOS-SPF-Test (Linux)</h1>
The steps are similar to those for installation on Windows.
You need only the following files from the project root:
<ul>
    <li/>JavaPOS-SPF-Test.sh
    <li/>jpos.properties
    <li/>jpos.xml
    <li/>jar\JavaPOS-SPF-Test.jar
</ul>
If the services you like to test use JavaPOS-SPF, the following additional file must be present in the jar folder:
<ul>
    <li/>jar\JavaPOS-SPF.jar
</ul>
If the device you like to test uses COM ports for communication (no matter if real COM ports, via Usb2Serial or Bluetooth),
you need one of
<ul>
    <li/>jar\SerialIOJNALinux.jar,
    <li/>jar\SerialIOJSerialComm.jar or
    <li/>jar\SerialIOJSSC.jar (only if Java version &lt; 9).
</ul>
and the corresponding jar files from project JNA (version &ge; 5.5, needed by SerialIOJNALinux.jar), JSerialComm (version
&ge; 2.6, needed by SerialIOJSerialComm.jar) or jSSC (version &ge; 2.7, needed by SerialIOJSSC.jar). if you use SerialIOJNALinux.jar,
it can be necessary to create a property file <i>de.gmxhome.conrad.JNALinux.JnaLinuxSerial.properties</i> as well.<br>
Currently, recommended for serial communication are jar\SerialIOJSerialComm.jar in combination with jSerialComm-2.6.2.jar.<p/>
Since you like to test some device services, you need the corresponding jar files as well.<p/>
If you like to use one of the device simulators of JavaPOS-SPF, add the corresponding jar file as well.<p/>
In addition, you need the jar files from the following projects:
<ul>
    <li/>jpos (version 1.14),
    <li/>log4j (version 1.2),
    <li/>xalan (version 2.7).
    <li/>xerces (version 2.7).
</ul>
Here the steps for installation:
<ul>
    <li/>If not present: Install a Java runtime with version &ge; 9 and JavaFX.
    <li/>Set the environment variable <b>JAVA_HOME</b> to the folder where you installed the Java runtime. This should
    be done automatically by the packet manager.
    <li/>Set the environment variable <b>JFX_HOME</b> to the folder where you installed JavaFX. If you use a JRE which
    includes JavaFX, <b>JFX_HOME</b> must not be set.
    <li/>Copy JavaPOS-SPF-Test.sh and jpos.xml to any target folder.
    <li/>Create a sub-folder <i>res</i> in a sub-folder <i>jpos</i> in the target folder
    <li/>Copy jpos.properties into that <i>jpos/res</i> sub-folder.
    <li/>Create a sub-folder <i>jar</i> in the target folder.
    <li/>Copy all necessary jar files into that <i>jar</i> sub-folder.
    <li/>Add entries for the devices you like to test to jpos.xml in the target folder.
</ul>
That's all! Start JavaPOS-SPF-Test.cmd to start your tests.
